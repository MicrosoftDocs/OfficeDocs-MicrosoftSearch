# Troubleshooting guide for ServiceNow Catalog Microsoft Graph connector

### 1. **Unable to sign in due to Single Sign-on enabled ServiceNow instance**

If your organization has enabled Single Sign-on (SSO) to ServiceNow, you may have trouble logging in with the service account. You can bring up username and password based sign-in by adding <em> `login.do`</em> to the ServiceNow instance URL. Example: `https://<your-organization-domain>.service-now.com./login.do`.

### 2. **Unauthorized or forbidden response to API request**

#### 2.1. Check table access permissions

If you see forbidden or unauthorized response in connection status, check if the service account has required access to the tables mentioned in [step 3: connection settings](#step-3-connection-settings). Check whether all the columns in the tables have read access.

#### 2.2. Change in account password

The connector uses access token fetched on behalf of service account for crawl. The access token refreshes every 12 hours. Ensure that service account password isn't changed after publishing the connection. You may need to reauthenticate the connection if there's a change in password.

#### 2.3. Check if ServiceNow instance behind firewall

Your Microsoft Graph connector may not be able to reach your ServiceNow instance if it is behind a network firewall. You'll need to explicitly allow access to connector service. You can find public IP address range of the connector service in the table below. Based on your tenant region, add it to your ServiceNow instance network allowlist.

 Environment | Region | Range
--- | --- | ---
PROD | North America | 52.250.92.252/30, 52.224.250.216/30
PROD | Europe | 20.54.41.208/30, 51.105.159.88/30
PROD | Asia Pacific | 52.139.188.212/30, 20.43.146.44/30

#### 2.4. Access permissions not working as expected

If you observe discrepancies in access permissions applied to search results, verify user criteria configuration in [applying user criteria to catalog items](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-it-service-management/page/product/service-catalog-management/task/t_AppUserCritItemsCat.html).

### 3. **Issues with *Only people with access to this data source* permission**

#### 3.1 Unable to choose *Only people with access to this data source*

You may not be able to choose *Only people with access to this data source* option if the service account doesn't have read permissions to the required tables in [step 3: connection settings](#step-3-connection-settings). Check whether the service account can read tables mentioned under *Index and support user criteria permissions* feature.

#### 3.2 User mapping failures

 ServiceNow user accounts that don't have a Microsoft 365 user in Microsoft Entra ID won't map. Non-user, service accounts are expected to fail user mapping. Number of user mapping failures can be accessed in identity stats area in connection detail window. Log of failed user mappings can be downloaded from Error tab.

### 4. **Issues with user criteria access flow**

If you see differences in the user criteria validation between ServiceNow and Microsoft Search, set `glide.knowman.block_access_with_no_user_criteria` system property to `no`.

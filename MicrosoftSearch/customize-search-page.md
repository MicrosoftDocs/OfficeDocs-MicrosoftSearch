# Customize the search results page

You can create search verticals and result types to customize the search results that users see when they search in Microsoft [SharePoint](https://sharepoint.com/), [Microsoft Office](https://office.com), and Microsoft Search in [Bing](https://bing.com). Verticals make it easier for users to find the information that they have permission to see. For example, you could create a search vertical for marketing analysis data from third-party software for your users in the marketing department. You can also define result types and customize the layout for this data.  

You can create verticals and result types at these levels:

- **Organization level** – When you add a vertical at the organization level, it appears on the search results page when users search from their [SharePoint](https://sharepoint.com/) start page, on [Office](https://office.com), or on [Bing](https://bing.com).
- **Site level** – For example, you might want to enable your customer service employees to search for *Severity 1* incidents directly from their department’s SharePoint site.

## Search verticals explained

At the top of the Microsoft Search results page, there's a row of tabs. These are the search verticals. A search vertical only shows results of a certain type or from certain content. Examples are **Files** or **News**. By default, Microsoft Search shows the verticals **All**, **People**, **Files**, **Sites**, and **News**.  

You can add search verticals that are relevant to your organization. These will appear on the Microsoft Search results page in [SharePoint](https://sharepoint.com/), [Office](https://Office.com), and [Bing](https://bing.com). For example, you could create a vertical for marketing-related content and another for sales, based on the type of information that each group needs. You can add verticals to show results only from content indexed via connectors.  

>[!NOTE]
> Verticals and result types are currently in preview as a part of the Microsoft Graph connectors preview and you can't use them for content that resides in [SharePoint](https://sharepoint.com/). For more about the preview, see [Connectors preview](connectors-preview.md). To participate in the preview, you must first submit the [Microsoft Graph Connectors Preview Signup form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbRxWYgu82J_RFnMMATAS6_chUNVYwNU1CMDNZUDBSSDZKWVo2RDJDRjRLQi4u).

## Things to consider

Before you start, make sure that the connector has been indexed. This can take up to 48 hours, depending on the file size.

There are three basic steps to add a vertical:

1. Create the vertical. In this step, you define the vertical’s name, content source, and scope of the content to search.
2. Define what the results for this vertical will look like.  
3. Enable the vertical (to be displayed) from the vertical list page.

## STEP 1: Create the search vertical

After you start the wizard, you're guided through the steps to define the vertical's name, content source, and scope of the content to search. The vertical is created in a disabled state. You'll enable it later.

You can use a limited set of [Keyword Query Language (KQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/general-development/keyword-query-language-kql-syntax-reference) to narrow the scope. This page lists the properties that are available. We recommend that you use freetext keywords and property restrictions with boolean operators for creating the KQL.

### Create a vertical at the organization level

To create the vertical on Microsoft Search in [SharePoint](https://sharepoint.com/) home, [Office](https://office.com), or [Bing](https://bing.com), follow these steps:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), go to [**Verticals**](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch/verticals).
1. Select **Add** to get started.  

### Create a vertical at the site level

1. On the [SharePoint](https://sharepoint.com/) site where you want the vertical, go to **Settings**.
1. Select **Site information** and then **View all site settings**.
1. Look for the **Microsoft Search** section, and then select **Configure Microsoft Search for this site collection**.
1. In the navigation pane, go to **Custom experience**, and then select the **Verticals** tab.
1. To add a vertical, select **Add**.
  Or, to edit a vertical, select it in the list.

Remember, verticals are created in a disabled state. They must be enabled before users can see them.

## STEP 2: Create the result types

You can define how results are displayed in the vertical by designing the layout using result types. The result layout lets you show important information directly in the search results, so users don't have to select each result to see if they found what they're looking for.

A search result type is a rule that causes distinct kinds of search results to be displayed in different ways. It consists of the following:

- **One or more conditions** to compare each search result against, such as the content source of the search result.  
- A **result layout** to use for search results that meet the conditions. The result layout controls the way that all results that meet the conditions appear and behave on a search results page.

**You must create at least one result type for results to display on the vertical.** You can create multiple result types for each vertical, which allows you to use different layouts for different type of results. For example, you can customize *Severity 1* incidents to have more prominent colors and a larger font compared to *Severity 3* incidents.

After you start the wizard, you're guided through the steps to define the name, content source, and conditions for the result type. You can define the priority of the result type from the list view.
  
### Create a result type at the organization level

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), go to [**Result types**](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch/resulttypes).
1. To add a **Result type**, select **Add**. To edit a result type, select the result type in the relevant list.

### Create a results type at the site level

1. On the [SharePoint](https://sharepoint.com/) site where you want to create the result type, go to **Settings**.
1. Select **Site information** and then **View all site settings**.
1. Look for the Microsoft Search section, and then select **Configure Microsoft Search for this site collection**.
1. In the navigation pane, go to **Custom experience**, and select **Result type** tab.
1. To add a result type, select **Add**.  Or, to edit a result type, select the result type in the list.

### View the vertical after it's enabled

After you enable the vertical, it might take a while before you can view it. If you don't want to wait after enabling it, you can append **cacheClear=true** to the URL in [SharePoint](https://sharepoint.com/) and [Office](https://office.com) to view the vertical immediately.

## Troubleshooting

Here's a list of common issues you might encounter and actions to fix them.

|Error  |Action  |
|---------|---------|
| I see a "Something went wrong" error message on the vertical. | Both the vertical and result types are needed to complete the setup. Make sure you have created both for the same content source. |
| I don't see my result layout, although I created one. | It takes a few minutes because these settings are generally cached. Wait for a few minutes and try again.        |
| I don't see any content sources on the vertical or result type page. | Make sure you have configured connectors and indexed data.   |

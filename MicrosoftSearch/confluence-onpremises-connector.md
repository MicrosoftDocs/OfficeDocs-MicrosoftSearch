# Confluence on-premises Microsoft Graph connector (Preview)

The Confluence on-premises Microsoft Graph connector allows your organization to index Confluence server or data center content. After you configure the connector and index data from the Confluence site, end users can search for those contents in Microsoft Search.

>[!NOTE]
>The Confluence on-premises connector is in preview. If you wish to get early access to try it, sign up using [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/JniPmK5bzm).

This article is for Microsoft 365 administrators or anyone who configures, runs, and monitors a Confluence on-premises connector. It supplements the general instructions provided in [**Set up Microsoft Graph connectors in the Microsoft 365 admin center**](configure-connector.md).

Each step in the setup process is listed below along with either a note that indicates you should follow the general setup instructions OR other instructions that apply to only Confluence on-premises Graph connector including information about [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) and [Limitations](#limitations).

## Before you get started

### Install the Microsoft Graph connector agent (GCA)

To index your Confluence server or data center content, you must install and register the connector agent. See [install the Microsoft Graph connector agent](./graph-connector-agent.md) for details.

You must be the administrator for your organization's Microsoft 365 tenant and the administrator for your organization's Confluence site.

>[!NOTE]
>GCA can be installed on a different Windows machine and need not be on the same machine as that of the on-premises server. The machine can help generate App ID and secret which can be used for the setup. You must ensure that the GCA machine is on during the crawling. 

## Step 1: Add a connector in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Follow the general instructions in [Step 1: Add a Microsoft Graph connector in the Microsoft 365 admin center](./configure-connector.md#step-1-add-a-microsoft-graph-connector-in-the-microsoft-365-admin-center).

## Step 2: Name the connection

Follow the general instructions in [Step 2: Name the connection](./configure-connector.md#step-2-name-the-connection).

## Step 3: Configure the connection settings

### Step 3.1: Select deployment type

Select *Server or Data center* option to index Confluence On-premises content and select next.

### Step 3.2: Enter Confluence instance URL

To connect to your Confluence site, use your site URL.

### Step 3.3: Select the Microsoft Graph connector agent

Select the connector agent from the drop-down list. The agent will securely send Confluence On-premises content into Microsoft Graph index.

### Step 3.4: Install Confluence On-Prem Plugin
 
   - Download the app from [Microsoft Graph Connectors Confluence On-prem Plugin | Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1234846?tab=overview&hosting=datacenter).

![undefined (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58ba9e9e-e2c9-47e9-967d-401cd79a7c5d)

### Step 3.5: Select authentication type

You can choose either Basic Authentication or OAuth 1.0a (recommended) to authenticate to your Confluence site.

>[!TIP]
>Make sure the **service account has view access** to the Confluence content you want to index.

#### Basic Authentication (Available only for testing in preview): 

Enter a service account's username (usually email ID) and password to authenticate using basic auth.

#### OAuth 1.0a 

Generate  a public/private key pair and create an application link in Confluence On-premises site so that the connector agent can access the instance. To learn more, see [step 1 in Atlassian developer documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/oauth/#step-1--configure-jira) on how to configure OAuth 1.0a.

#### Step 3.5.1 Generate an RSA public/private key pair

Run the following openssl commands in your on-premises machine terminal.

Step | Command
--- | ---
Generate a 1024-bit private key |`openssl genrsa -out confluence_privatekey.pem 1024`
Create an X509 certificate |`openssl req -newkey rsa:1024 -x509 -key confluence_privatekey.pem -out confluence_publickey.cer -days 365`
Extract the private key (PKCS8 format) to the `confluence_privatekey.pcks8` file | `openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in confluence_privatekey.pem -out confluence_privatekey.pcks8`
Extract the public key from the certificate to the `confluence_publickey.pem` file | `openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in confluence_publickey.cer > confluence_publickey.pem`

#### Step 3.5.2 Create an application link

1. In Confluence, navigate to **Administration** (cog icon) > **General configuration** > **Application Links** in the side pane.

2. In the **Enter URL of the application you want to link** text box, enter any URL. For example, `https://example.com` and then select **Create new link**. Ignore *No response was received from the URL you entered* warning and select **Continue**.

3. On the first screen of **Link applications** dialog, provide an **Application Name** and select **Generic Application** type. Select the **Create incoming link** checkbox. All other fields are optional. Select **Continue**.

   :::image type="content" alt-text="Link Applications dialog" source="media/confluence-connector/confluence-onpremises-applications-link-1.png":::

4. On the second screen of **Link applications** dialog, enter consumer details for sample client:

   Field | Recommended Value
   --- | ---
   **Consumer key** | `OAuthkey`
   **Consumer name** | `Microsoft Graph Connector App`
   **Public key** | Copy the public key from `confluence_publickey.pem` file generated from *Step 3.4.1* and paste it into this field (for example, `iuasge87awegrq3...`).

5. Select **Continue**. After successful creation, the application link will be displayed like the following screen.

   :::image type="content" alt-text="Link Applications post creation" source="media/confluence-connector/confluence-onpremises-applications-link-2.png" lightbox="media/confluence-connector/confluence-onpremises-applications-link-2.png":::

#### Step 3.5.3 Enter consumer key and private key to sign in

In the connection creation configuration assistant in Microsoft 365 admin center, enter the **Consumer key** created during *Step 3.4.2* and **Private key** from `confluence_privatekey.pcks8` file in *Step 3.4.1*. Enable pop-up in the browser for Microsoft 365 admin center and select **Sign in**.

#### Step 3.5.4 Enter verification code to Finish Sign in

In the Confluence sign in screen, enter service account credentials. After successful sign-in, you'll get a verification code like the following screen.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Verification code" source="media/confluence-connector/confluence-onpremises-applications-link-3.png" lightbox="media/confluence-connector/confluence-onpremises-applications-link-3.png":::

Enter the **Verification Code** in connection creation configuration assistant and select **Finish Sign in**. After successful sign-in, select **Next**.

#### OAuth 2.0 (Recommended)

The following steps provide guidance on how to register the app [Configure an incoming link](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configure-an-incoming-link-1115674733.html) 

1. Go to Administration  > General Configuration > Application links. 
2. Select Create link
3. Select External application, and then choose Incoming as the direction. 
4. Fill in the 
   - Redirect URL: `https://gcs.office.com/v1.0/admin/oauth/callback` 
   - Scope: **Admin**
5. Complete the connection settings step using the Client ID and Secret. 

## Step 4: Select properties

In this step, you can add or remove properties from your confluence data source. M365 has already selected few properties by default.

**Specify the spaces you want to index:** By default, the connector will index all spaces. However, you can choose to include or exclude specific spaces using the space filter option. Enter the list of space keys you wish to include or exclude, and you will see a preview of the results.
Space key: Each Confluence space has a **space key**, which is a short, unique identifier that forms part of the URL for that space. To get the space key please contact confluence admin

>[!NOTE]
   > * CQL is not supported for Confluence on-premises.
   > * Conflunce On-prem indexes only current pages and not archived pages

## Step 5: Manage search permissions

Confluence On-premises connector supports search permissions visible to **Everyone** or **Only people with access to this data source**. If you choose **Everyone**, indexed data will appear in the search results for all users. If you choose **Only people with access to this data source**, indexed data will appear in the search results for users who have access to them.

In Confluence On-premises, security permissions for users and groups are defined using space permissions and page restrictions. Confluence On-premises connector applies *effective permissions* provided by [content restrictions API](https://docs.atlassian.com/ConfluenceServer/rest/7.15.0/#api/content/{id}/restriction).

If you choose **Only people with access to this data source**, you need to further choose whether your Confluence site has Microsoft Entra ID provisioned users or Non-AAD users.

To identify which option is suitable for your organization:

1. Choose the **Microsoft Entra ID** option if the email ID of Confluence users is **same** as the UserPrincipalName (UPN) of users in Microsoft Entra ID.
2. Choose the **Non-AAD** option if the email ID of Confluence users is **different** from the UserPrincipalName (UPN) of users in Microsoft Entra ID. 

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > * If you choose Microsoft Entra ID as the type of identity source, the connector maps the Email IDs of users obtained from Confluence directly to UPN property from Microsoft Entra ID.
   > * If you chose "Non-AAD" for the identity type see [Map your non-Azure AD Identities](map-non-aad.md) for instructions on mapping the identities. You can use this option to provide the mapping regular expression from Email ID to UPN.
   > * Updates to users or groups governing access permissions are synced in full crawls only. Incremental crawls do not currently support processing of updates to permissions.

## Step 6: Assign property labels

Follow the general [setup instructions](./configure-connector.md).

## Step 7: Manage schema

Follow the general [setup instructions](./configure-connector.md).

## Step 8: Choose refresh settings

Follow the general [setup instructions](./configure-connector.md).

>[!NOTE]
>For access permission updates, only full crawl scheduled will be applied.

## Step 9: Review Connection

Follow the general [setup instructions](./configure-connector.md).

After publishing the connection, you need to customize the search results page. To learn about customizing search results, see [Customize the search results page](./configure-connector.md#step-11-customize-the-search-results-page).

For testing purpose, you can choose [publish to limited audience](./staged-rollout-for-graph-connectors.md#modify-or-stop-staged-rollout)   

## Limitations

The confluence On-premises connector has the following known limitations in its latest release:

* Confluence On-premises connector doesn't index blogs, attachment files and comments.

## Troubleshooting
After publishing your connection, you can review the status under the **Data Sources** tab in the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com). To learn how to make updates and deletions, see [Manage your connector](manage-connector.md).
You can find troubleshooting steps for commonly seen issues [here](troubleshoot-confluence-onpremises-connector.md).

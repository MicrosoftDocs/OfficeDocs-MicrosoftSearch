# Provide feedback for Microsoft Search connectors

The Microsoft Graph connectors team responds to the search admin community across several channels:

* **Documentation feedback:** If you have questions about the Microsoft Graph connectors documentation or want to tell us what you like or don't like, you can provide feedback at the bottom of any article.
* **Feature requests:** If our platform doesn't empower you to do what you need, make your feature suggestions under the category **Connectors** on [Microsoft User Voice](https://microsoftsearch.uservoice.com/forums/926998-connectors).

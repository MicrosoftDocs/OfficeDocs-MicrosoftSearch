# Microsoft Search for US government environments

This article provides an overview of feature differences between the US government clouds and the commercial cloud for Microsoft Search. Microsoft Search availability for US government clouds is outlined below.

It is our general intent to deliver Microsoft Search commercial features and functionality to the government cloud environment. For a release time frame, see the [Microsoft Search Roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=Microsoft%20Search).

Microsoft Search provides an easy-to-use, familiar experience to help users find files and documents, internal sites, people, groups, and answers. It does this by securely accessing multiple data sources, including Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive, and other shared Microsoft 365 resources. With Microsoft Search in Bing users can get search results from the internet as well.

To get personalized, organization-wide results, users enter a search query in a search box on [SharePoint](http://sharepoint.com/), [Microsoft OneDrive for Business](https://onedrive.live.com/about/business/), or any Office 365 app. When enabled, users who go to [Bing](https://bing.com), and sign in with a valid work account, can easily and securely find work results with Microsoft Search in Bing. To learn more about Microsoft Search features, see [Microsoft Search Overview](/microsoftsearch/overview-microsoft-search).

For GCC customers, Microsoft Search in Bing is off by default. Search admins can turn on Microsoft Search in Bing:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), go to [Configurations](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch/configurations).
1. Under Microsoft Search in Bing settings, choose **Change settings** and turn on **Allow your organization to use Microsoft Search in Bing**.
It takes up to 24 hours for this change to take effect.

Search admins can also customize bookmarks and Q&A answers in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Plan your content](/microsoftsearch/plan-your-content).

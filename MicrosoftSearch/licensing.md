# License requirements and pricing

This article is for global or billing admins who want to learn about how to purchase more Microsoft Graph connectors quota for their organization.

Any valid **Microsoft 365 or Office 365 license** allows you to view data from connectors in your search results.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>All of the connectors by Microsoft are free. However, you need to have sufficient index quota to ingest content from those connectors.

To index content by using Microsoft Graph connectors, you need to have sufficient index quota. Microsoft Graph connectors index quota is available via:

- Built-in entitlements
- Purchase of add-on index quota

## Entitlement built into Microsoft 365 or Office 365 E5 licenses

The following licenses include entitlement to 500 items of index quota, which counts towards your organization's quota for ingesting content from Microsoft Graph connectors:

*  Microsoft 365 Copilot
* The Microsoft 365 E5 or Office 365 E5
* [Microsoft Viva Topics](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/topics?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

For example, if your organization has 100 Microsoft 365 E5 licenses, then your organization has 100 x 500 = 50,000 items worth of Microsoft Graph connectors index quota.

<!---Comment requested in PR#143--->
> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft 365 A5 and Office 365 A5 do not include this entitlement.

## Purchase of add-on index quota
To purchase more Microsoft Graph connectors quota, contact your Microsoft account manager or complete the following steps:

1. In the **[Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com)**, go to **Billing > Purchase services**.
2. At the bottom of the Purchase services page, select **Add-ons**.
3. Select **Extra Graph Connector Capacity**.
4. Select **Buy**, and then complete your order preferences.
5. Select **Check out now**.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, Microsoft Graph connectors only support up to 50 million items of total index quota, which includes any built-in quota bundled into Microsoft 365 or Office 365 E5 licenses. The platform supports higher limits in the future. If you have any questions, contact Microsoft support or your Microsoft account manager.
>
> Preview connectors do not count against quota; after a connector becomes generally available, it starts to count on the total index quota.

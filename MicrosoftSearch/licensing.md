# License requirements and pricing

This article is for Global or Billing Admins who want to learn about how to purchase more Graph connectors quota for their organization.

Any valid **Microsoft 365 or Office 365 license** allows you to view data from connectors in your search results.

> [!TIP]
> **Microsoft Graph connectors promo code**:
> If you don't have index quota available and want to try Microsoft Graph connectors, now you can request a **Promo code** from your Microsoft account manager. With the promo code you will get a six month trial.


>[!IMPORTANT]
>All of the Graph connectors by Microsoft are free. However, you need to have sufficient index quota to ingest content from those connectors.

To index content using Graph connectors, you need to have sufficient index quota. Graph connectors index quota is available via:

## Entitlement built into Microsoft 365 or Office 365 E5 licenses

The following licenses include entitlement to 500 items of index quota, which counts towards your organization's quota for ingesting content from Graph connectors:

* The Microsoft 365 E5 or Office 365 E5
* [Microsoft Viva Topics](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/topics?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

For example, if your organization has 100 Microsoft 365 E5 licenses, then your organization has 100 x 500 = 50,000 items worth of Graph connectors index quota.

<!---Comment requested in PR#143--->
Note that Microsoft 365 A5 or Office 365 A5 do not include this entitlement.

## Purchase of add-on index quota
To purchase more Graph connectors quota get in touch with your Microsoft Account Manager, or complete the following steps:

1. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**: https://<span>admin.microsoft.</span>com navigation menu, go to **Billing > Purchase services**.
2. At the bottom of the Purchase services page, select **Add-ons**.
3. Select **Extra Graph Connector Capacity**.
4. Select **Buy** then complete your order preferences.
5. Select **Check out now**.


> [!NOTE]
> Currently, Microsoft Graph connectors only support up to 7 million items of total index quota, which includes any built-in quota bundled into Microsoft 365 or Office 365 E5 licenses. The platform will support higher limits in the future. Please contact Microsoft support or your Microsoft account manager if you have any questions.
> Preview connectors do not count against quota, after a connector becomes generally available, it starts to count on the total index quota.

# License requirements and pricing

This article is for Global or Billing Admins who want to learn about how to purchase more Graph connectors quota for their organization.

Any valid **Microsoft 365 or Office 365 license** allows you to view data from connectors in your search results.

> [!TIP]
> **Microsoft Graph connectors & Viva Topics Trial Now Available**:
> If you don't have index quota available and want to try Microsoft Graph connectors now you can request a **Promo code** with [Microsoft Viva Topics](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/topics?activetab=pivot:overviewtab), as detailed [here](#microsoft-graph-connectors-now-available-with-microsoft-viva-topics-trial).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>All of the Graph connectors by Microsoft are free. However, you need to have sufficient index quota to ingest content from those connectors.

To index content using Graph connectors, you need to have sufficient index quota. Graph connectors index quota is available via:

## Entitlement built into Microsoft 365 or Office 365 E5 licenses

The following licenses include entitlement to 500 items of index quota, which counts towards your organization's quota for ingesting content from Graph connectors:

* The Microsoft 365 E5 or Office 365 E5
* [Microsoft Viva Topics](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/topics?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

For example, if your organization has 100 Microsoft 365 E5 licenses, then your organization has 100 x 500 = 50,000 items worth of Graph connectors index quota.

<!---Comment requested in PR#143--->
Note that Microsoft 365 A5 or Office 365 A5 do not include this entitlement.

## Purchase of add-on index quota
To purchase more Graph connectors quota get in touch with your Microsoft Account Manager, or complete the following steps:

1. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**: https://<span>admin.microsoft.</span>com navigation menu, go to **Billing > Purchase services**.
2. At the bottom of the Purchase services page, select **Add-ons**.
3. Select **Extra Graph Connector Capacity**.
4. Select **Buy** then complete your order preferences.
5. Select **Check out now**.

## Microsoft Graph connectors now available with Microsoft Viva Topics trial
 The new Viva Topics trial allows you to evaluate both Microsoft Graph connectors and Viva Topics in development and/or production environments. It provides a limited connector capacity in addition to access to Viva Topics.

There are two options to explore Graph connectors with Microsoft Viva Topics:

1. **Start a free trial**, and get access during one month, for 25 users.

     Visit [Microsoft Viva Topics](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/topics?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) and select the Free trial option.

2. Contact your Microsoft account manager to request a **Promo code** for trial index capacity with Microsoft Viva Topics trial. With a **Promo code** you can get access during six months, for 50 users.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, Microsoft Graph connectors only support up to 7 million items of total index quota, which includes any built-in quota bundled into Microsoft 365 or Office 365 E5 licenses. The platform will support higher limits in the future. Please contact Microsoft support or your Microsoft account manager if you have any questions.
> Preview connectors do not count against quota, after a connector becomes generally available, it starts to count on the total index quota.
